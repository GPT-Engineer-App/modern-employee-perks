#### **1. Login and Onboarding**

The **login screen** will feature a subtle gradient or abstract pattern as its background, creating a visually appealing and modern aesthetic. The login form will be centralized with ample whitespace around it, enhancing focus and readability. Users will have options to log in via email and password, and there will be prominent buttons for "Login" and "Sign Up". Additionally, Single Sign-On (SSO) options with social media icons such as Google and LinkedIn will be available. For convenience, links to "Forgot Password" will be included, and smooth fade-in and transitions for form elements will ensure a polished user experience.

During **onboarding**, users will be guided through a step-by-step process using modern, flat-style illustrations. The layout will include a progress indicator to show the user‚Äôs advancement through the setup. Micro-interactions, such as subtle animations for button presses and transitions, will enhance engagement and make the onboarding process more enjoyable.

#### **2. Home Dashboard**

The **home screen** will use a card-based layout to display the balance overview, with a gradient background and large text to highlight the current balance. Recent transactions will be shown as a mini-list below the balance. Quick access buttons for common actions will be rounded with soft shadows and vibrant colors like blue, green, and orange. Featured perks will be displayed in a horizontally scrollable carousel with high-quality images or icons. Users will also have the option to toggle between light and dark modes via a setting.

The **navigation bar** will feature modern vector-based icons with text labels for clarity. It will be fixed at the bottom for mobile devices and positioned as a sidebar for web interfaces, ensuring easy access to main sections.

#### **3. Perks and Discounts**

In the **perks screen**, category tabs will be pill-shaped with hover animations, using pastel shades to maintain a fresh look. A prominent, centered search bar with an icon and placeholder text will facilitate quick searches. The list of deals will adopt a card-style layout, displaying vendor logos, descriptions, and ‚ÄúRedeem‚Äù buttons, along with user ratings or reviews. Filters and sorting options will be accessible through a collapsible panel to keep the interface clean and organized.

The **perk detail screen** will feature large images at the top, followed by detailed vendor information with icons for contact methods and a map integration for location. The ‚ÄúRedeem‚Äù button will be prominent and will change colors or have animations on hover or click to make it stand out.

#### **4. Wallet and Spending**

The **wallet screen** will use graphical representations like progress bars or pie charts to display balance and spending limits. Clear, bold text will highlight the balance. Adding funds will be facilitated by a floating action button (FAB) with a plus icon, and the transaction history will be presented in a timeline layout with icons and descriptions. Funding details will be displayed in an infographic style with icons and charts for clarity.

The **transaction detail screen** will have a clear layout, providing a detailed breakdown of transaction information. A drag-and-drop area will allow users to easily upload receipts.

#### **5. Activity and Notifications**

The **activity screen** will feature a timeline with icons and smooth animations for new entries. An interactive chart and graph display will provide a summary of spending, allowing users to hover over elements for more detailed information.

In the **notifications screen**, alerts and updates will be displayed in a card-based layout with dismiss buttons for easy management. Customization options for notification preferences will be provided through toggle switches.

#### **6. Profile and Settings**

The **profile screen** will present user information in a modern layout, with the profile picture at the top and editable fields for personal details. Large buttons will facilitate actions such as updating the profile. The settings section will include switches and sliders for various settings, providing real-time updates. An expandable FAQ section and a chat support button will be available in the help and support area.

In the **settings screen**, security settings will be managed through modern toggles and input fields, while privacy settings will be displayed using card layouts with explanations and toggle switches. App settings will allow users to customize themes and language options, with real-time previews to see changes instantly.

#### **7. Admin Interface**

The **admin dashboard** will feature an overview section with cards and charts displaying high-level data. Interactive elements will allow admins to dive into detailed views. Employee management will be facilitated through a table with filter options and action buttons. Perk management will include modern forms with drag-and-drop functionality. Reports will be interactive and exportable, featuring graphs and charts for detailed analysis.

### Visual Design

The **color scheme** will include vibrant primary colors like blues and greens, complemented by bold accent colors for call-to-action elements. A dark mode option will use deep grays and accent colors.

**Typography** will feature modern, sans-serif fonts with a clear hierarchy, using large headings and readable body text.

**Icons and imagery** will be vector-based and minimalist, maintaining a consistent style. High-quality images and illustrations will be used, complemented by subtle animations to enhance the user experience.
